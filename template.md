This is where you add the description. Try to write a small paragraph about what the trail is like. Are there multiple trails? How hard are the trails? What do you like about the trail? How is the parking? Anything we should look out for? What else should we know about the trail? Bathrooms?

Perhaps a picture. To add a picture add the picture to the folder and name it something reasonable, then add the image to the markdown file. Try not add massive image check out [https://squoosh.app/](https://squoosh.app/) to reduce it (a width of 800px is more than enough I think)
